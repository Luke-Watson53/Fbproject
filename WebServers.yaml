What is a Network?
In information technology, a network is defined as the
connection of at least two computer systems, either by a
cable or a wireless connection.

Remote Servers:
Elastic Cloud Compute --> EC2 in AWS

Connecting to a remote server:
  SSH --> Secure Shell

1. With a Key:
ssh -i "key.pem" user@publicIP

ssh -i webserverkey.pem ec2-user@18.224.165.109


- ec2-user (redHat)
- Ubuntu (ubuntu)
- key (pair)
Example:
  ssh -i webserverkey.pem ubuntu@18.224.165.109

2. With a password:

ssh ubuntu@18.224.165.109

Note: 
Password Authentication is disabled by default.
We need to enable it in order to login using a password.

How to enable password Authentication:
  sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config "no" to "yes"
- sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/60-cloudimg-settings.conf
- Update PasswordAuthentication yes
- Restart SSH -> sudo systemctl restart ssh

Create a user and assign the user a password:
  Commands:
    Create a user:
      sudo adduser <username>
      sudo adduser roland

    Assign the user a password:
      sudo passwd <username> --> you will be prompted
                                  to type the password
                                  and repeat it.
                                  The password is invisible.
      sudo passwd roland

Now login from anywhere using the password method.

ssh roland@public IP  
ssh roland@3.21.228.181

How to know the public IP from the CLI:

How to Connect to a remote host:
  SSH --> Secure Shell (Port 22)

  LAN:
    - IP: A logical address of a device in a network.
    - SWITCH: Connects devices within the same network.
    - ROUTER: A networking device that forwards data  
              packets between different computer networks.
    - SUBNET: Defines your local area network IP range.

  WAN:
    - FIREWALL: A set of passive rules that protect your
                network from unauthorized access.
    - PORT FORWARDING: Redirects a communication request
                       from one address and port number
                       combination to another while 
                       packets are traversing a network 
                       gateway such as a router.

    - NAT GATEWAY: Network Address Translation is a 
                   method of remapping an IP address 
                   while they are in transit across a 
                   traffic routing device.

A subnet is like a network within a network.
When you partition an IP network into smaller 
segments, each with its own set of IP addresses, 
these segments become subnets.

Subnets are designed to achieve fast, efficient, 
and resilient computer networks

CLOUD COMPUTING:
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services 
over the internet, also known as "the cloud". 

These services include:
 - Compute (servers), ec2.instances
 - storage, s3
 - databases, 
 - networking, vpc
 - software, 
 - analytics, and intelligence.
 - Etc.

 Provider: AWS, GCP, Alibaba, Azure, etc 

AWS Cloud
=========
VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD (Virtual Data Center)

1.VPC - Virtual Private Cloud: 

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) is a service 
provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you 
to create isolated network environments for your AWS 
resources. 

Here are the key points about Amazon VPC:

A VPC is like your private slice of the AWS network.
It provides a logically isolated virtual network 
where you can launch AWS resources.
__________

2. Internet Gateway:

The Internet Gateway acts as a bridge between your 
VPC and the internet.
It enables communication between resources within 
your VPC and external networks, including the public 
internet. Both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic are supported

__________

3. Subnets:

A subnet, also known as a subnetwork, is a logical 
subdivision of a larger network.

4. Route Tables:

A routing table is like a distribution map for data 
packets traveling over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.
It is stored in a router or network host and lists 
the routes to specific network destinations

5. Routing:

Routing is the process of selecting and defining paths 
for IP-packet traffic within or between networks

Routing ensures that data packets reach their intended 
destinations efficiently.

It involves determining the best path for data to travel 
from its source to its destination.

Routers play a crucial role in making these routing 
decisions.

6. Bastion Host / Jump Server:

A bastion host (jums server) is an Amazon EC2 instance 
that serves as a secure gateway, allowing authorized 
users to access private instances within an Amazon 
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment.

STEPS IN CREATING OUR VPC IN AWS.
=================================

1. Create a VPC - Virtual Private Cloud
2. Internet Gateway
3. Subnets
4. Route tables
5. Routing -path
6. Provision resources (ec2.instance)
7. Bastion Host / Jump Server
8. VPC Peering

_____________________________________________________

How to Create a VPC in AWS:

1. On AWS Console, search for VPC -> Click Create VPC
-> give the VPC a name (example: "Spark-VPC")
-> IP range(CIDR block) 12.0.0.0/16
   (To calculate the number of IPs (www.cidr.xyz))
   
   *Click Create VPC.

2. Create Internet Gateway
   -> Internet Gateways (IG)
   -> Name of IG e.g. "Spark-IGW"
  *Click Create Internet Gateway  

Check State: Detached

We need to Associate the Internet Gateway to our VPC  
Click on the Internet Gateway ID
Actions: -> Attach to VPC 
         -> Select Spark-VPC
         -> Attach VPC.

3. Create Subnets
On VPC console, click on Subnets
NB: We neet to create Subnets, 1 private and 1 Public
  -> Create Subnets

Public Subnet:
  -> Select VPC | Spark-VPC
  -> Name: spark-Subnet-Public-a
  -> Availability Zone: Select thesame for both xa  
  -> IPv4 cidr 12.0.1.0/24  (256)

Private Subnet:
  -> Select VPC | Spark-VPC
  -> Name: spark-Subnet-Private-a
  -> Availability Zone: Select thesame for both xa  
  -> IPv4 cidr 12.0.2.0/24 (256)

4. Route Table  
   Create 2 route tables 
   One for the spark-Subnet-Private-a &
   one for the spark-Subnet-Public-a

  On console, under VPC, click
  -> Route Tables
  -> Create route table
  -> spark-RT-public
  -> VPC: Spark-VPC
  *Create Route Table 

5. Provide Route:
    -> Actions -> Edit Route
    -> Add Route 0.0.0.0/0 i.e. from anywhere
    -> Target: IGW- (spark-IGW) -> Save  

  Associate to Publuc Subnet: On route table click:
    Subnet Association: -> Edit Subnet Association 
    Select the Public Subnet and Save Association. 


  On console, under VPC, click
  -> Route Tables
  -> Create route table
  -> spark-RT-private
  -> VPC: Spark-VPC
  *Create Route Table
  
Note:
The Private Subnet doesn't need to be linked or 
attached to the Internet Gateway because it shouldn't
be accessed from the internet (external to the VPC)
Consequently, no route will be created.

However, we should associate the private route table 
to the private subnet.

 On the private route table, click on:
  Edit Subnet Association:
    Select the Private Subnet -> Save Association.

6.  We can now provision resources in the various
   subnets as per the use case. 
   For resources that should not be publicly 
   accessible like databases and other enterprise
   applications, they will be provisioned in the
   private subnet.

   For other resources like web servers or end-user
   applications, they will be deployed on servers
   in the public subnet.

7. Bastion Host | Jump Server.

  A jump server is an intermediary server responsible 
  for funneling traffic through firewalls using a 
  supervised secure channel. It acts as a proxy server 
  that has two network interface cards to connect to two 
  networks.

  Demo:
    Create 2 ec2 intances;
    1 in the public subnet (bastion host/jump server)
    1 in the private subnet (e.g. database server)

    The server in the private subnet will not have 
    a public IP, as it will not be publicly 
    accessible.

    On the security group setting, allow traffic only  
    from servers in the public subnet or only from the 
    IP of the jumpServer.

    NOTE:
    =====
    1. What is the maximum number of IP addresses in a 
    VPC?
    Answer: 65,536 i.e. up to /16.  

    2. How many VPCs can an aws account create?
    Answer: You can create up to 5 VPCs per AWS Region 
            by default.
